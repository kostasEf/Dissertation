 *  DONE  Place more than one room in the maze.
 *  DONE  Fix empty cells issue(itterate through cells table, find null and create them)
 *  DONE  Instantiate Room at RandomRoomCoordinates.
 *  DONE  Create Different Room prefabs.
 *  DONE  Fix Crashing when there is not enough space to place a room (adjust Maze size depending on Room number).
 *  DONE  Rooms have now at least one cell between them.
 *  DONE  Fix Entry and Exit points.
 *  DONE  Fix the fucking camera angle
 *  DONE  Fix the fucking camera position (depending on maze size????)

 *  Think of mini game ideas:
 *  1. Hole on the ground, ball falls inside a container, 
 *     bend left or right to move the ball against the container and make it fall fall.
 *     
 *  2. Third person view where you turn camera by moving the device and to roll the ball you have to bend forward.
 *  
 *  3. Fall on a slide where obstacles come and in order to avoid them you need to bend left-right
 *  
 *  Add a colider above the maze so the ball will not fall off.
